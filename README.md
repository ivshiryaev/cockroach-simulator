Okay the main idea here is that you are a cockroach.
Each second you lose health, eat the food to heal yourself.
Beware of human(yeap, this ugly sphere is a human, try to imagine it :) If he will catch you - you lose.
If you don't eat, you die because of starving. 

There is also dishes count on the top left of the screen, it keeps tracking the dishes that you throw off the table. Try to throw them all !

---------------------

WASD - move
Left Shift - sprint
Space - jump
You can make a double jump

---------------------

Try jumping on the chairs, they work like a trampoline
If you die, press Alt+F4 (didn't made a restart/quit button)
