-----------------

The main idea here is that you are a cockroach. Each second, you lose health. Eat the food to heal yourself. Beware of humans (yep, this ugly sphere represents a human; try to imagine it). If he catches you, you lose. If you don't eat, you die due to starving.

There is also a dish count on the top left of the screen; it keeps track of the dishes that you throw off the table. Try to throw them all!

Controls:

WASD: move
Left Shift: sprint
Space: jump (you can make a double jump)
Try jumping on the chairs; they work like trampolines. If you die, press Alt+F4 (I didn't add a restart/quit button).
